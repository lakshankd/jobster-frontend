        One of the main areas that I work on with my clients is shedding these
        non-supportive beliefs and replacing them with beliefs that will help

        It is truly amazing the damage that we, as parents, can inflict on our
        children. So why do we do it? For the most part, we don’t do it
        intentionally or with malice. In the majority of cases, the cause is a
        well-meaning but unskilled or un-thinking parent, who says the wrong
        thing at the wrong time, and the message sticks – as simple as that!
