                      Motivation is not an accident or something that someone
                      else can give you — you are the only one with the power to
                      motivate you. Motivation cannot be an external force, it
                      must come from within as the natural product of your
                      desire to achieve something and your belief that you are
                      capable to succeed at your goal. Success is something of
                      which we all want more.

                      We all carry a lot of baggage, thanks to our upbringing.
                      The majority of people carry with them, an entire series
                      of self-limiting beliefs that will absolutely stop, and
                      hold them back from, success. Things like “I’m not good
                      enough”, “I’m not smart enough”, “I’m not lucky enough”,
                      and the worst, We carry them with us like rocks in a
                      knapsack, and then use them to sabotage our success. So,
                      how twisted is that?!?!
